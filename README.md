# systeam-reporting

This contains various scripts meant for sulreports.stanford.edu,
to do reporting around system states.  In some cases these wrapper
other software to gather data from several sources and clean it up
into a format we like.

These are currently written in multiple languages, though in the
long term we'll rewrite and standardize on Ruby, or Python for
anything that relies on Python libraries.
